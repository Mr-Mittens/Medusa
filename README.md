### Medusa 

Medusa is a dwm rice which is simple and aesthetic with no complexity!

- minimal setup with less bloat
- cool setup for a low-end spec hardware 
- comes along with some base install [scripts](https://github.com/Mr-Mittens/Medusa/tree/main/scripts)
- pure black GTK [theme](https://github.com/Mr-Mittens/Medusa/tree/main/black-GTK/sample) added.
- vim scripts added avoiding bloated plugins
